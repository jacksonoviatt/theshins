            <h1>The Shins</h1>
            <p>
                The Shins are an American indie rock band formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1996. Its current lineup is James Mercer (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, songwriter), Jon Sortland (drums), Mark Watrous (guitar, keyboards), Casey Foubert (guitar), Yuuki Matthews (bass, keyboards), and Patti King (keyboards).It is based in Portland, Oregon.

                The band was formed by Mercer as a side project to Flake Music, who were active from 1992 to 1999. Flake Music released two 7" singles and a full-length album When You Land Here It's Time to Return on Omnibus Records and were touring with Modest Mouse when they were signed to Sub Pop Records. The band's first two records, Oh, Inverted World (2001) and Chutes Too Narrow (2003) performed well commercially and received critical acclaim. The single "New Slang" brought the band mainstream attention when it was featured in the 2004 film Garden State. Consequently, the band's third album, Wincing the Night Away (2007), was a major success for the group, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 and earning a Grammy Award nomination.

                Following this, the Shins signed to Columbia Records and Mercer parted ways with the entire original lineup, deeming it "an aesthetic decision." Following a near five-year hiatus, Port of Morrow, the band's fourth studio album, was released in 2012. Their fifth album, Heartworms, was released in March 2017.

                Mercer described the Shins as a "pop project" from the beginning. The group were inspired by any and all music that they discovered. "Everything we listen to makes its way in somehow, but we've been inspired by a bunch of bands who basically just keep reinventing the same thing," said Mercer. The group received comparisons to the "pop revivalists" at the Elephant 6 Recording Collective early in their career,[clarification needed] such as The Apples in Stereo,whilst Mercer's vivid, often surrealist lyrics and infectious melodies drew comparisons to the songwriting style of Robert Pollard from Guided by Voices. Rolling Stone credited the band with bringing "the pop traditions of 1960s pop bands—groups like the Zombies, and the Beach Boys—to a new generation of music fans.

            "New Slang" is a song by American rock band The Shins, released on February 19, 2001 as the lead single from the group's debut studio album, Oh, Inverted World (2001). Written by guitarist and vocalist James Mercer, it concerns his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico and his experiences there in his late 20s. The lyrics are fueled with "angst and confusion," as Mercer was finding himself constantly depressed and disconnected from his friends and scene. The song attracted attention from Sub Pop Records, who issued the song as a single in February 2001. The buzz created by the song led to positive press for the group's debut album, Oh, Inverted World.

                All three versions of the single are currently available on the United Kingdom iTunes. It is one of the songs on the soundtrack of the Xbox 360 game Project Gotham Racing 4 and was also released as downloadable content for the Rock Band video game series initially through the Rock Band Network, then in 2018 as DLC for Rock Band 4.

                The lyrics of the song have many interpretations. Despite its name, the song's lyrics do not reference Australia at all.

                The official music video was directed by Matt McCormick. It shows the band members arriving at a car dealership. While one of them poses as a customer to distract the salespeople, the others coordinate a theft of the many gas-filled balloons the dealership has affixed to their cars and to advertise their merchandise. They are discovered but manage to escape with the balloons in their van while the decoy walks away undisturbed. The group drives the van to a field where they release the balloons and watch them rise into the sky.
